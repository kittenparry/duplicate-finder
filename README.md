Find pesky space-eaters that you so carelessly scatter around.

Geared toward my personal use. I'm not sure if I can make it useful to anyone else, since it specifically looks 1-level inside every folder in Archive/Downloads directories, using the directory style from [pddcat](https://github.com/kittenparry/pddcat). Source paths could be made configurable but it would still bear the aforementioned problem.
